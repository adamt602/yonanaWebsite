    <strong>Canvas:</strong> <a href="https://canvas.ucsd.edu/courses/40756" class="uri">https://canvas.ucsd.edu/courses/40756</a><br>
    <strong>Textbook:</strong> M. Sipser, <em>Introduction to the Theory of
        Computation</em> (any edition)</p>
<p><strong>Course Description:</strong> In this course, we will explore
    what it means for a problem to be “computable”, i.e.&nbsp;solvable by an
    algorithm or computer program. We begin with a very simple model of
    computation, and work our way to the most powerful, the Turing machine,
    named after <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/history/people/alan_turing">Alan Turing</a>,
    who formalized the notion of “algorithm” even before there were any
    physical computers. You’ll also learn about the relationship of these
    models to some essential tools in a computer scientist’s toolkit, such
    as regular expressions and context-free grammars. Finally, you’ll
    develop your technical communication skills in writing formal arguments
    and proofs.</p>
<p><strong>Tools:</strong> See course <a href="index.html">webpage</a>
    for additional information on <strong>Piazza</strong> (discussion
    board), <strong>Gradescope</strong> (homework submission, grading),
    <strong>iClickers</strong> (active learning/attendance),
    <strong>FLAP/flap.js</strong> (machine visualization) and
    <strong>LaTeX/Overleaf</strong> (typesetting.) Enrollment/access to
    Piazza and Gradescope should be automatic through Canvas. Make sure you
    have your clicker registered on Canvas by Sunday, Oct 2. Intallation
    instructions for JFLAP/flap.js and LaTeX/Overleaf are on the course
    webpage.</p>

</ul>
<p><strong>Course Calendar</strong>: For weekly topics, reading
    assignments and homework due dates, see the course calendar posted on
    the course <a href="index.html">webpage</a>. You are responsible for all
    the reading material posted up to the current lecture. (Slides/lecture
    notes available on Canvas.)</p>
<h2 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h2>
<p>The formal prerequisites for CSE 105 are CSE 12 and CSE 21, as well
    as all implied prerequisites of those classes (most importantly CSE 20.)
    One of Math 15B, Math 100A, or Math 103A may substitute for CSE 21.</p>
<p>We expect you to be comfortable with mathematical concepts such as
    sets, tuples, relations, and functions. You should in particular be
    familiar with the notion that a set is (or isn’t) closed under some
    operation. We expect you to be comfortable with manipulating formal
    mathematical definitions, reading and writing formal proofs.</p>
<p>We further expect you to be comfortable with basic data structures,
    such as trees and graphs; with basic algorithms on those data
    structures, such as depth-first search and graph reachability; with
    basic tools of algorithm analysis, such as big-O notation; and with
    general computer and programming concepts, so to be able to easily pick
    up a new programming language and write short snippets of code.</p>
<h2 id="objectives">Objectives</h2>
<p>Our objectives in CSE 105 are: (1) to define computation formally;
    (2) to show that there are limits to what is computable; (3) to reason
    precisely about computation and its limits. Along the way, we will pick
    up some useful tools (finite automata, regular expressions, context-free
    grammars) and lay the foundation for the study (in CSE 200) of
    complexity theory.</p>
<p><strong>Learning outcomes.</strong> A successful student will learn
    the following in CSE 105:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Recall, understand and manipulate formal definitions for DFAs, NFAs,
        CFGs, and TMs, and understand implications of these definitions and
        variants thereof.</li>
    <li>Understand and manipulate language definitions written in
        “set-builder” notation.</li>
    <li>Understand and generate closure-property proofs for claims of the
        form “if <em>L</em> is a regular language, then so is <em>f(L)</em>” for
        <em>f</em> transforming a language into another, and also for other
        classes of languages than regular languages.</li>
    <li>Understand the meaning and implications of closure properties,
        especially for the standard language operations; e.g., if two languages
        are not regular, can/must their concatenation be regular?</li>
    <li>Understand and use reductions for decidability and undecidability,
        and mapping reductions for recognizability.</li>
    <li>Given a language, determine whether it is decidable or undecidable
        and prove that claim formally and convincingly.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="assignments-and-course-policies">Assignments and Course
    Policies</h2>
<p><strong>iClickers:</strong> We will use iClickers as a learning tool
    and to measure class attendance/partecipation. Make sure you have your
    clicker registered with Canvas by <strong>Sun October 2</strong>. See
    course <a href="index.html">webpage</a> for instructions.</p>
<p><strong>Attendance:</strong> Podcast recordings of the lectures will
    be available (shortly after class, typically within a day) at <a href="https://podcast.ucsd.edu/watch/fa22/cse105_a00" class="uri">https://podcast.ucsd.edu/watch/fa22/cse105_a00</a> for
    review, or for making up for occasionally missing a lecture. Still, you
    are expected to <strong>attend lectures in person</strong> (unless you
    are sick), make sure that your iClicker is registered in Canvas, and use
    it to <strong>actively partecipate</strong>. You should
    <strong>not</strong> come to lecture if you are sick or not feeling
    well. In order to allow some flexibility, the iClicker/partecipation
    score will <strong>not</strong> directly contribute a fixed portion of
    your grade. Rather, it will be used to determine your “discretionary
    score” (see below.)</p>
<p><strong>Exams:</strong> There will be 2 midterm exams and a final.
    Midterm and Final exams dates/times have been set by the university
    before registration (Midterms are during regular class times), and
    everybody is expected to attend. There will be no make up midterm or
    final. Not showing up to either exam will count as 0 grade, unless your
    absence is due to a demonstrated personal health problem at the time.
    Exams will be closed book, closed notes.</p>
<p><strong>Homework</strong> assignments will <em>typically</em> go out
    Thursday night, and be due on Friday the following week. (See course
    webpage for assignment schedule.) So, there will be one day overlap
    between the two. This is to allow you to look at the assignment before
    the discussion on Friday. You should try to submit your homework by
    Thursday, so you can focus on the new assignment. Think of the Friday
    deadline as a one-day extension, in case you need that extra time for
    whatever reason. No submissions will be accepted after Friday. Homework
    assignments are distributed on Canvas and submitted on gradescope.
    Homework should be done in groups of <strong>one to three</strong>
    people. You are free to change group members at any time throughout the
    quarter. Problems should be solved together, not divided up between
    partners. A <strong>single representative</strong> of your group should
    submit your work through Gradescope. On submission, make sure to add all
    your group members to the Gradescope assignment. Submissions must be
    received by 11:59pm on the due date, and there are no exceptions to this
    rule. We recommend that you submit early drafts to Gradescope so that in
    case of any technical difficulties, at least some of your work is
    present. You may update your submission as many times as you’d like up
    to the deadline. Additional submission instructions may be provided on
    each individual homework assignment.</p>
<p><strong>Grades</strong> for homework and midterm exams will be
    available through Gradescope. The course grade is based on your
    homework, midterm exams and a final exam. Denoting your percentage
    scores on these as <em>H</em>, <em>M</em>, <em>F</em>, we compute your
    raw score <em>RS</em> and total score <em>TS</em> via the formulas</p>
<blockquote>
    <p><em>RS</em> = 0.35 <em>H</em> + 0.30 <em>M</em> + 0.35 <em>F</em></p>
    <p><em>TS</em> = 0.95 <em>RS</em> + 0.05 <em>DS</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>where <em>DS</em> is your discretionary score, to be explained. Your
    grade is determined by your total score TS. Now let us explain. In
    computing the raw score, homework weigh 35%, midterm exams 30% and the
    final exam 35%. In determining <em>H</em>, homework assignments are
    weighted equally, and the lowest homework score is dropped. For
    <em>M</em>, the two midterms also carry equal weight (15% each), but the
    weight of your lowest midterm will be moved to the final exam if your
    final score is higher than that midterm. (So, the final exam is your
    opportunity to improve a low midterm score.) Your total score is 95%
    your raw score RS and 5% your discretionary score DS. How is DS
    computed? Its default value is RS. Thus, if you do nothing to either
    increase or decrease it (which is likely true for most students), then
    TS is just RS. However it is possible to increase DS, and also possible
    to decrease it, relative to its default value RS. Actions that may
    increase your discretionary score DS above RS include attending lectures
    (with attendance recorded by iClicker partecipation), answering Piazza
    posts by other students, creating positive impression through
    interaction or posts, spotting mistakes or bugs in our posts, etc.
    Actions that may decrease your discretionary score DS below RS include
    requesting exceptions to policies stated here or on the slides, asking
    administrative questions already answered here or on the slides,
    requesting actions already denied by policies here on the slides and
    asking for special consideration. The latter includes asking that your
    grade depend on things beyond your performance. An example is ``Please
    pass me because I am graduating this quarter.’’ This is not appropriate
    because it is effectively asking for unfairness, that you be treated
    differently from other students.</p>
<p>The class is <em>not</em> graded on a curve. There is no fixed
    correspondence between letter grades and particular scores, nor is the
    grade distribution dependent in some fixed way on statistics such as the
    average or standard deviation. But, just to give you an indication of
    where you are headed, in the past grades followed roughly the following
    scale: 50-55% (D), 55-70% (C), 70-85% (B), 85-100% (A), with (+) and (-)
    assigned to the instructor discretion. This includes, but is not limited
    to improvement over the quarter, class participation, and natural
    “breaks” in the distribution of scores. As per university rules, a P
    means a C- or above.</p>
<p><strong>Regrade requests</strong>. Regrades need to be requested
    within three days of announcement of grades. The regrade window will be
    set in Gradescope. In the regrade request, include a brief but detailed
    explanation of why you think there was an error in the grading. A
    regrade request may lead to us reviewing the entire assignment and may
    lead to the score being adjusted up or down depending on any errors
    found in the original grading. There will be no regrade window for the
    final exam. Finals will be available for inspection only after the
    quarter is over and class grades have been assigned.</p>
<p><strong>Academic honesty:</strong> All students are expected to be
    familiar with and abide by the rules of UCSD Policy on Integrity of
    Scholarship as described in the UCSD General Catalog. In case of
    cheating, such policy will be enforced. This means an F grade in the
    course, and action by the Dean of your college (probation or suspension
    from UCSD).</p>
<p><strong>Homework and Collaboration Policy</strong> You are encouraged
    to form study groups to discuss the material presented in class and the
    homework assignments. However, you should write the solutions to the
    homework entirely on your own or within your team. If you collaborated
    with other students on the solution of the homework (beside your team
    mates), you must list the name of everyone you discussed the homework
    with, and which problems you discussed with whom.</p>
<p>You can use Internet, additional textbooks, and any material you find
    useful as a study tool. However, the use of any such resource in the
    solution of homework assignments is prohibited. In particular, you
    should <strong>not</strong> search for solutions to homework problems
    on-line, or post homework related questions on any site other than the
    course web discussion board. Should you still (inadvertently) come
    across material on the internet that is closely related to the solution
    of the homework assignments, make sure you clearly aknowledged your
    source in your solutions to avoid academic dishonesty charges. Posting
    of your solutions (as a whole, or in part, even after the homework due
    date) is also prohibited. No form of collaboration is allowed during
    midterm and final exams.</p>

<h2 id="diversity-and-inclusion">Diversity and Inclusion</h2>
<p>We are committed to fostering a learning environment for this course
    that supports a diversity of thoughts, perspectives and experiences, and
    respects your identities (including race, ethnicity, heritage, gender,
    sex, class, sexuality, religion, ability, age, educational background,
    etc.). Our goal is to create a diverse and inclusive learning
    environment where all students feel comfortable and can thrive.</p>
<p>Our instructional staff will make a concerted effort to be welcoming
    and inclusive to the wide diversity of students in this course. If there
    is a way we can make you feel more included please let one of the course
    staff know, either in person, via email/discussion board, or even in a
    note under the door. Our learning about diverse perspectives and
    identities is an ongoing process, and we welcome your perspectives and
    input.</p>
<p>We also expect that you, as a student in this course, will honor and
    respect your classmates, abiding by the UCSD Principles of Community (<a href="https://ucsd.edu/about/principles.html" class="uri">https://ucsd.edu/about/principles.html</a>). Please
    understand that others’ backgrounds, perspectives and experiences may be
    different than your own, and help us to build an environment where
    everyone is respected and feels comfortable.</p>
<p>If you experience any sort of harassment or discrimination, please
    contact the instructor as soon as possible. If you prefer to speak with
    someone outside of the course, please contact the Office of Prevention
    of Harassment and Discrimination: <a href="https://ophd.ucsd.edu/" class="uri">https://ophd.ucsd.edu/</a>.</p>
